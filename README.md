# 50days50projects
50 small and basic projects to train basic front-end skills.

All projects are made with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS only.

Also, these projects are my own version of those featured in the course "50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript", made by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop, and available at Udemy.
